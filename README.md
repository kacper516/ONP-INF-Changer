# ONP-INF-Changer
ONP is also known as reverse ≈Åukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.

In this program we can put some INF: (normal mathematic rules) equation to file then this program will change it to ONP: if it's possible, because there is some rules that equality must meet.
<br/><br/>
Also this program will work with ONP: equation and change it to INF: rule (if it's possible).
